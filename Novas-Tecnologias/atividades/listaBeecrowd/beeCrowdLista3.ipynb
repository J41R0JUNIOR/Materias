Pilots are identified by integers from 1 to P. Each of the following G lines indicates the result of a race, and contains Q integers separated by spaces. On each line, the (i)-th number indicates the order of arrival of pilot i in the race (the first number indicates the order of arrival of a pilot 1 in that race, the second number indicates the order of arrival of pilot 2 in that race and so on). The next line contains a single integer S indicating the number of scoring systems (1 ≤ S ≤ 10), After that, each of the following lines S contains a description of a scoring system. The description of a scoring system begins with an integerK (1 ≤ K ≤ P), indicating the last finishing order to receive points, followed by a blank space, followed by e K integers k0, k1, ... , kn−1 (1 ≤ ki ≤ 100) separated by spaces, indicating the number of points to be assigned (the first integer indicates the points for first place, the second integer indicates the points for second place and so on).
